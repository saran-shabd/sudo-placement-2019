# sudo-placement-2019

This repository contains all the problems that I solved in *Sudo Placement 2019* on [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/). I didn't solve all the problems though. Some of the problems were too easy to be solved and some were a bit tought.

All of these problems are at moderate level.

Test cases are also written for all the problems (almost). All the test cases that I failed during the submissions (which were later resolved) are included for each problem.

Any suggestions or improvements are welcomed, but only in `Java`.
